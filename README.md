Instructions: Clone repo then in terminal 'npm install'. Next ‘brew update’ (for Mac) then install mongo through brew and follow the instructions for setting up data/db file including changing permissions if needed, then in terminal run mongod. Then do npm test to see if the tests are working or npm start to see if it starts. To be clearer, run mongod from the NDCS server folder then create another terminal instance in that same folder and run the server or test both terminal windows should be running at once. Next create a file named ‘.env’ and paste env variables in it (contact me for env vars).
